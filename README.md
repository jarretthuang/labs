# Welcome to labs.jhuang.ca

Hi internet, this is Jarrett Huang.

I wrote this React app as a way for me to learn how the framework works as I mostly use Angular on a daily basis. As it turns out, React is quite fun and easy to get started with. This app/website has now become a lab where I'll be adding more apps, tools, and web code experiments.

Hope you can find something interesting and useful here. Happy coding!

Jarrett
