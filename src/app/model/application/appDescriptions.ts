export const homeAppDescription = `
The _Home_ app is the home page of _labs.jhuang.ca_ which provides an entry point to each other app.

This app leverages technologies like _CSS Grid_ to create a proportional UI adjusting to the viewer's screen size dynamically.

As web design tools develop, we no longer have to fit our UI in the traditional 3 x 4 layouts. Empty space has also become more intuitive and practical, and very much meaningful in the design of a layout.

Learning this has enabled many possibilities for me, as a web developer, to create layouts for not just "pages", but full-fledged applications.

To me, web is also an _art form_. I wish to do more web layout experiments in the future. :)

export const jsonViewerAppDescription = `
The _JSON Viewer_ app is a handy tool that I use regularly. It parses the text that you provide and if text is valid JSON,
offers functionalities to auto-indent or minimize it, among a few other things.

In the _View_ tab, a nicely configured tree structure will be generated for you to visualize your JSON object.

export const colourPickerAppDescription = `
Ever had trouble finding a "good colour" when you're writing UI code?

This app was created a while ago for me to quickly generate a random colour with a name. I've used it extensively over the years.
Credits go to [Ntc.js](https://chir.ag/projects/ntc/).

I sense a lot of more advanced features coming to this app. Stay tuned!

export const threeAppDescription = `
I recently fell in love with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). (and you should too!)

This app is our love child.
