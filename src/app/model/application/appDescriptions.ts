export const homeAppDescription = `
The _Home_ app is the home page of _labs.jhuang.ca_.

This app uses CSS-Grid to create a proportional UI regardless of screen sizes.

With CSS-Grid and other similar technologies, we are no longer required to fit our UI in the traditional 3 x 4 layouts. Empty space has also become more intuitive, practical, and very much meaningful in the design of a layout.
To me, this has enabled many possibilities for the web, to be not just "pages", but full-fledged apps. And perhaps an art form.

export const jsonViewerAppDescription = `
The _JSON Viewer_ app is a handy tool that I use regularly. It parses the text that you provide and if text is valid JSON,
offers functionalities to auto-indent or minimize it, among a few other things.

In the _View_ tab, a nicely configured tree structure will be generated for you to visualize your JSON object.

export const colourPickerAppDescription = `
Ever had trouble finding a "good colour" when you're writing UI code?

This app was created a while ago for me to quickly generate a random colour with a name. I've used it extensively over the years.
Credits go to [Ntc.js](https://chir.ag/projects/ntc/).

I sense a lot of more advanced features coming to this app. Stay tuned!

export const threeAppDescription = `
I recently fell in love with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). (and you should too!)

This app is our love child.
